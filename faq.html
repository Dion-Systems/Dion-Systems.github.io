<h2 class="subtitle padtop2"><span class="anchor" id="what_is_dion?"></span>What is Dion?</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span>
Dion is <a class="link" href="team.html">our</a> project to build a better format for storing structured information on computers, which notably includes (but is not limited to) the code that we use to program computers. We've identified problems with using text files as the base format for this purpose, so our goal is to provide an alternative format to text files, and to also provide tools to work with that format. We think that this can help make our programming tools smarter, more accessible, easier to learn how to use, faster, and less of a pain in general.

<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span>
Dion is more-or-less a name we've given to the entire project of shifting the fundamental axioms of our programming systems in favor of something that—we hypothesize—can be much better. This whole project may include many tools. Our original demo at <a class="link" href="https://handmade-seattle.com">Handmade Seattle</a> presented a prototype that featured a tightly coupled system, where all three of these things lived very close to each other. We then learned how to get many of the benefits we presented in the original <a class="link" href="https://handmade-seattle.com">Handmade Seattle</a> demo, but without tightly coupling all of these systems, and it involves a new format for code. So, these days, "Dion" refers to the project of building that new format, and the tools around it.

<h2 class="subtitle padtop2"><span class="anchor" id="what_is_the_business_model_of_dion?"></span>What is the business model of Dion?</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span>
The <a class="link" href="team.html">Dion team</a> is currently comprised of three part-time volunteers who work on the project in our free-time, so there isn't really a business model currently. We do not make any money from Dion right now, and we will continue to work on it as volunteers for the time being. Our future plans for a business model are to-be-determined, but we know that much of our work will be public and open.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle padtop2"><span class="anchor" id="will_dion_be_open-source?"></span>Will Dion be open-source?</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span>
We expect to publish many things as open or open-source, most notably the Dion format specification itself. We also plan to release our metaprogramming utility <a class="link" href="metadesk.html">Metadesk</a> under the MIT license. We have not decided the answer to this question for all code we write as part of the Dion project; it is certainly possible that certain projects we work on will not be open-source.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle padtop2"><span class="anchor" id="how_will_version_control_work_with_a_new_format?"></span>How will version control work with a new format?</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span>
Integrating with existing programming workflows is crucial when developing programming tools. However, the goals of Dion make this challenging. That being said, we hope to integrate with existing version control systems to the extent that we can, using custom diff and merge utilities for the new format. The diff and merge implementation will obviously not take the same form as it does with text files (one possible avenue is a graph-based diff), but this does not prevent us from, for example, working with Git. More details will become available as we get further in our research and development.

<h2 class="subtitle padtop2"><span class="anchor" id="what_is_metadesk?"></span>What is <a class="link" href="metadesk.html">Metadesk</a>?</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span>
<a class="link" href="metadesk.html">Metadesk</a> is an open-source tool that we developed for metaprogramming, data generation, and code generation. The name "<a class="link" href="metadesk.html">Metadesk</a>" really applies to two things: A data description language, and a library that we developed for working with that language. That library includes utilities for parsing strings of the <a class="link" href="metadesk.html">Metadesk</a> language to an abstract syntax tree, introspecting on those abstract syntax trees, doing code generation, and more.

<h2 class="subtitle padtop2"><span class="anchor" id="how_does_metadesk_relate_to_the_dion_format?"></span>How does <a class="link" href="metadesk.html">Metadesk</a> relate to the <a class="link" href="dion_format.html">Dion Format</a>?</h2>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span>
These projects are only related in the sense that <a class="link" href="metadesk.html">Metadesk</a> is helping us build the <a class="link" href="dion_format.html">Dion Format</a>, and both projects are being built with a very similar philosophy behind them. <a class="link" href="metadesk.html">Metadesk</a> is not the <a class="link" href="dion_format.html">Dion Format</a>, it is purely a utility that we're using for the current programming systems that we are all used to.
