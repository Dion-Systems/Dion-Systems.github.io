<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span><strong>Computer software began with patch cables and switches.</strong> Further advancements then allowed software to be encoded into punched cards, which could be fed into a more general-purpose computer. Not too long after, programming largely shifted away from punch cards, and towards digitally-encoded text files that a programmer could edit with a text editor program.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span><strong>Progress continued.</strong> Over the next four (or so) decades, programming tools built for these text files continued to mature; we got version control systems, syntax highlighting, smarter text editor features, among many other things...</p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span><strong>...but advancement stagnated</strong>. Over four decades after the world largely switched to storing computer programs as text files, programming largely feels the same, and in many ways, worse than it used to.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span>Today, code editors and development environments feel slower and dumber than they should, despite hardware having monumentally improved. They seem to fail at doing anything useful in the presence of trivial mistakes. Learning about how a program is actually working is notoriously difficult, even for experts using specialized tools like debuggers, which are <i>specifically</i> made for informing a user how a program is actually working. Learning how to program <i>at all</i> in the first place is a seemingly impossible task for many.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="anchor" id=""></span>At Dion Systems, we have a theory: many of these problems are because of architectural decisions made a long time ago. Those decisions go largely unquestioned in the modern programming world, but we think to fix these problems, it is going to require rethinking those decisions, and starting from scratch.</p>
